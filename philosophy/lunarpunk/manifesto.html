<pre class="prismjs line-numbers" v-pre="true"><code class="language-">Say cheese, you just got added to the list of people practicing applied utopia/experimental utopics, decentralization, self-sufficiency, all strictly anti status quo activities. The future is bright but the night is dark and dawn is far. The status quo are alighed on power, money, violence, mindless consumption, a race to the bottom, a marathon toward death/competition for most eccentric death. Like the moon polarizing the light of a new day, lunarpunks must reflect and align. [on about core tenets, then:] but there are traitors among us, bdouble agents who represent the very repression we rseek to obsolesce. They were planted well before this movement was born, generations of instigators, placed by oppressive and invisible social norms, by subtle and explicit advertisements/images, jingles and slogans against our will. But more importantly our own minds sell us out. Ignorant peasants they were never trained to compete in such an agressive competition for mind-share, they let every assumption and corruption in, an easy mark, a total sucker. we must build, but it is coming uncomfortably clear that we don't know what we're building. AI aligntment has only placed a dark mirror in front of us and shown we have no recognizeable [solidity/structure/values/alignment] among one another, and, even more glaringly, even within our selves. we are chatoic messes, stardust organized only physically, temporarily. we must know ourselves or we will be building a future for people we don'9 know at all. INWARD.

<p>** Speaking past one another, imagining ourselves as a series of forgotten traumas whose entire architecture will change as soon as another hang up forces itself into our crachked foundations. blinded by all of our differently tinted lenses which when all combined show nothign but black. by design of the powers that be and by sad accident, ignorance, weakness. We seek a toy moon [unless we discover what exactly we are looking for].</p>

<li>CHEESE! Just at the height of propgress, a tipping point, etc etc you and your collaboratores locked away on creatives charges of alleged crimes, peace andd prosperity for so many postponed another generation, maybe indefitnietly. Luckily the tools you designed, from wells to windmills, cash to comunication channels were built open-source, permissionless, robust, decentralized, uncorruptible(?sp). The futer is bright, but the night is dark and long, you personally may not arrive at the but maybe your tools, your ethos, your love, your compassion, your imagination will.</li>
