<p># Draft</p>
<p>CHEESE!<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>At the zenith of your work you and your collaborators have been jailed on charges of practicing applied utopics<sup>2</sup>. The promise of peace and prosperity for so many in desperate need has been postponed now another orbit. Thankfully, the gravity of this movement is greater than its mass of people and ideals. From wells to windmills, cash to communication channels, your tools were open source, permissionless, robust, decentralized and incorruptible in a way our individual identities could never be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We must defend our future if we expect to have any. &nbsp;We must build impermeable shields against the coercive rays of power, money, violence, mindless consumption, a race to the bottom, a new game with which to supplant the competition whose prize is the most eccentric death. We build with cryptography, distributed networks, sustainable infrastructure, open-source code, from biotechnology to synthetic intelligences. We build against corruption in the form of both deliberate attacks and accidental catastrophes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must build defensively. A defensive system is not a hostile system. A defensive system empowers individuals and communities to maintain autonomy when desired and only when desired. Neither its ends or means are objectively criminal. Our aim is not to topple or break, but to build systems so resiliently antifragile that they inevitably supersede the status quo. Our purpose is not mere survival, nor simply to reclaim our autonomy, but regeneration, not just to protect but to accelerate the flourishing of free societies in an uncertain world. We write contracts together, in the open so that they can deceive no one, least of all ourselves, to be signed or not by our own volition. Like the polarized light of the full moon we work to align our momentum in an unstoppable orbit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are traitors among us; double agents who represent the very oppression we seek to obsolesce have built fortified outposts in our minds. Their seeds were planted well before this tide began to rise; generations of instigators, buried and watered by invisible antagonizers in the forms of social norms, by subtle and explicit jingles and slogans meant to chip away at our free will. Ignorant yeoman, we have invited them in; our own minds sell us out, carefully domesticated by our enemies to their exact specification. We fight isolating, illusory, energy wasting battles against ephemeral shadows in the war for priceless mindshare.</p>
<p>Lunarpunks build, but it is becoming uncomfortably clear that we don't know what we're building. The task of AI alignment has only placed a dark mirror before us; we do not recognize ourselves. We are haphazard accretions, carelessly consolidated stardust, dissolving as quickly as we instatiate. We see through splintered lenses colored by myriad unnoticed tints; the additive specra clash, blinding us in twilight ignorance. We speak past one another, muffled shouts from vain and stilted precipices built on unsteady foundations. Our success extends only so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society, how can we be sure to meet when we are strangers unto ourselves? We risk laying only dimly lit dead ends paved with the rubble of naive hope for a future we don't know at all. We can seek only a toy moon.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The future is bright but the night is dark and dawn is further than you alone are capable of reaching. We must work together that our tools, our ethos, our love, our compassion, our imagination might precede us.</p>
<p>Inward.</p>

<p>1: English-language instruction used by photographers who want their subject or subjects to smile with their lips apart and teeth showing. Also the moon is made of cheese.</p>
<p>2: Utopics: as in the study/practice of utopia.</p>
<p>3: “Thou dost seek to walk where no path is, thou dost seek a toy moon…” from a Buddhist parable about desiring the impossible.</p>

<p>The prose above borrows heavily from Eric Hughes' Cypherpunk Manifesto.</p>
