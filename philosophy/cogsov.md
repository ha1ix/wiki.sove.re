# Overview
Cognitive sovereignty is freedom of thought — not just from external manipulation, but from one's own cognitive weaknesses and biases. It is the mental counterpart to the political and financial self-sovereignty pursued by the broader network-society movement: the idea that a person cannot meaningfully be self-governing if their beliefs and attention are not their own.

It connects naturally to [cypherpunk](/philosophy/cypherpunk) values (privacy as a prerequisite for free thought) and to the rationalist community that was a founding track at [Zuzalu](/network-societies/pop-ups/zuzalu).

## Concepts
- **Cognitive Security (CogSec)** — protecting one's epistemic environment from manipulation, misinformation, and adversarial persuasion. Analogous to OpSec for information.
- **Rationality** — developing reliable mental tools for forming accurate beliefs and making good decisions.
- **Meditation / introspection** — practices for observing and moderating one's own mental processes.
- **Epistemic autonomy** — forming beliefs through one's own reasoning rather than deference to authority or social pressure.
