# Overview

DeSci (Decentralized Science) applies Web3 tools — DAOs, tokens, on-chain IP, and [quadratic funding](/technology/software/quadratic-funding) — to the problems of scientific research: funding, publication, data access, and peer review. The argument is that traditional funding bodies and journals create bottlenecks that slow research, introduce bias, and lock knowledge behind paywalls.

# Connection to Zuzalu

Longevity and biotech research was one of the three founding tracks at [Zuzalu](/network-societies/pop-ups/zuzalu) in 2023, alongside Ethereum developers and rationalists. This made DeSci a recurring presence across the ZuVillage lineage — the overlap between people building decentralized infrastructure and people trying to accelerate longevity research proved natural, sharing the same instinct toward permissionless, open systems.

# Key Mechanisms

- **IP-NFTs** — tokenized intellectual property allowing research IP to be owned, licensed, and traded on-chain. Developed by [Molecule](https://molecule.to).
- **Research DAOs** — decentralized organizations pooling funds and governance to direct research spending. VitaDAO (longevity) is the most prominent example in this ecosystem.
- **Open data** — publishing datasets to decentralized storage (IPFS, Filecoin) to make them permanently accessible and citable.

# Notable Projects

- **[VitaDAO](https://vitadao.com)** — DAO funding early-stage longevity research. One of the earliest and most active research DAOs; closely connected to the Zuzalu longevity community.
- **[Molecule](https://molecule.to)** — platform for IP-NFTs and research funding infrastructure.
