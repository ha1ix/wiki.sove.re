The term "lunarpunk" has been used as a specific subset/addition/clarification to [solarpunk](/philosophy/solarpunk). It envisions the same sustainable, human-centric future based on technological development with an emphasis on the need for "defensive technologies," especially strong cryptography, and pragmatic caution. For this reason it could be considered ["defensive accelerationism"](/philosophy/dacc). Lunarpunk takes the imagined solarpunk world and adds some specific qualifications that are intended to ground the philosophy in a more defensive/offensive mindset.

In addition to the solarpunk ideals, lunarpunk emphasizes:
## Decentralization
    
   - Decentralization is not just a more local approach to community infrastructure, it is fundamental.
     - Open source everything.
## Individual sovereignity
     
   - While solarpunk is not collectivist to the detriment of the individual, lunarpunk makes this qualification explicit. Individual agency and liberty is paramount.
     - To this end, individual privacy is lunarpunk requisite, and [programmable cryptography](technology/software/programmable-cryptography) is as fundamental as ecologically responsible technologies.
    	- Privacy for individuals, transparency for power structures. 
## Defense/Caution/Pragmatism
    
   - While lunarpunk believes a much better civilization is possible, it points out that a better future is in no way inevitable and requires extensive effort to build toward.
   - Lunarpunk also emphasizes the many risks between us and the future we want, many of them existential, such as climate change, political disfunction, global pandemics, AI, and unknown unknowns.
## Summary     
One could imagine solarpunk as the utopian end goal, and lunarpunk as the pragmatism required to get there. Solarpunk x Cypherpunk = Lunarpunk
