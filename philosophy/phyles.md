# Overview

Phyles is a concept developed by Spanish economist David de Ugarte describing transnational groups that share cultural and economic ties, coordinate both online and offline, and function as a kind of voluntary non-territorial nation. The term and concept predate the crypto era.

[Vitalik Buterin](/people/vitalik-buterin) cited Phyles directly in [*Why I Built Zuzalu*](/network-societies/pop-ups/zuzalu/why-vb) as one of the intellectual precursors to Zuzalu, alongside Michel Maffesoli's *The Time of the Tribes* and Balaji Srinivasan's *The Network State*. He also listed it in his December 2025 essay [*Let a thousand societies bloom*](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/12/17/societies.html) as part of the broader "thousand nations bloom" intellectual tradition.
