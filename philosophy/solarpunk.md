# Overview
Like other "-punk" philosophies, solarpunk is a rebellion/protest movement. Specifically it is a protest against future where humans increasingly damage the environment, corporations have more and more control over society, technology is primarily for surveillance/profit, social/inequality worsens, and economics defines progress. Solarpunk is an optimistic vision of the future that combines sustainable technology, environmental harmony, and social justice. Some common solarpunk themes are:

- **Sustainability and High Technological Development**
    - Clean energy (especially solar) and green technology widely integrated into society
    - Nature and urban spaces coexist through green architecture and design
    - Technology serves human and ecological needs rather than corporate profits
- **Collectivism and Individuality**
    - Communities are resilient, collaborative, equitable and more personal
    - Collective action and individual responsibility are fundamental to paving this route to the future.
         - Despite the importance of dependence on others and the importance of collaboration, individual sovereignity and liberty is increased rather than diminished.
    - Focus on relationships and building instead of isolated comsumption, dynamic, diverse, flourishing human culture.
    - The means of production are decentralized, communities are bottom-up instead of top-down and infrastructure is much more local and human-centric.
    
Because solarpunk believes that responsibly implementd technological progress is the path forward, it is essentially [accelerationist](philosophy/dacc#accelerationism)

## Aesthetic
Solarpunk has a strong visual aesthetic, often showing walkable cities, small, diverse communities, and comfortable/human centric implementation of technologies. Often solarpunk cities are shown as very green with few cars. Unlike cyberpunk's dystopian, technologically driven corporate future, solarpunk envisions humanity solving climate change and social issues through sustainable innovation. In essence it is high tech futurism set in lush, naturally integrated environments.

A video called Dear Alice that went viral for its depiction of a solar punk lifestyle. Notice the abundance of technology, community, and integration with the natural environment. *Note: this was originally a yogurt ad, but [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U) has been decommodified*.
