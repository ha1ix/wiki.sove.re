# Overview
Like other "-punk" philosophies, solarpunk is a rebellion/protest movement. Specifically it is a protest against future where humans increasingly damage the environment, corporations have more and more control over society, technology is primarily for surveillance/profit, social/inequality worsens, and economics defines progress. Solarpunk is an optimistic vision of the future that combines sustainable technology, environmental harmony, and social justice. Some common solarpunk themes are:

- **Sustainability and High Technological Development**
    - Clean energy (especially solar) and green technology widely integrated into society
    - Nature and urban spaces coexist through green architecture and design
    - Technology serves human and ecological needs rather than corporate profits
- **Collectivism and Individuality**
    - Communities are resilient, collaborative, equitable and more personal
    - Collective action and individual responsibility are fundamental to paving this route to the future.
         - Despite the importance of dependence on others and the importance of collaboration, individual sovereignity and liberty is increased rather than diminished.
    - Focus on relationships and building instead of isolated comsumption, dynamic, diverse, flourishing human culture.
    - The means of production are decentralized, communities are bottom-up instead of top-down and infrastructure is much more local and human-centric.
    
Because solarpunk believes that responsibly implementd technological progress is the path forward, it is essentially [accelerationist](philosophy/dacc#accelerationism)

## Aesthetic
Solarpunk has a strong visual aesthetic, often showing walkable cities, small, diverse communities, and comfortable/human centric implementation of technologies. Often solarpunk cities are shown as very green with few cars. Unlike cyberpunk's dystopian, technologically driven corporate future, solarpunk envisions humanity solving climate change and social issues through sustainable innovation. In essence it is high tech futurism set in lush, naturally integrated environments.

A video called Dear Alice that went viral for its depiction of a solar punk lifestyle. Notice the abundance of technology, community, and integration with the natural environment. *Note: this was originally a yogurt ad, but [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U) has been decommodified*.

# Lunarpunk
The term "lunarpunk" has been used as a specific subset/addition/clarification to solarpunk. It envisions the same sustainable, human-centric future based on technological development with an emphasis on the need for "defensive technologies" and caution. For this reason it could be considered ["defensive accelerationism"](/philosophy/dacc). Lunarpunk takes the imagined solarpunk world and adds some specific qualifications that are intended to ground the philosophy in a more defensive/offensive mindset.

In addition to the solarpunk ideals, lunarpunk emphasizes:
- Decentralization
    - Decentralization is not just a more local approach to community infrastructure, it is fundamental.
- Individual sovereignity
    - While solarpunk is not collectivist to the detriment of the individual, lunarpunk makes this qualification explicit. Individual agency and liberty is paramount.
    - To this end, individual privacy is lunarpunk requisite, and [programmable cryptography](technology/software/programmable-cryptography) is as fundamental as ecologically responsible technologies.
- Caution
     - While lunarpunk believes a much better civilization is possible, it points out that a better future is in no way inevitable and requires extensive effort to build toward.
     - Lunarpunk also emphasizes the many risks between us and the future we want, many of them existential, such as climate change, political disfunction, global pandemics, AI, and unknown unknowns.
     
One could imagine solarpunk as the utopian end goal, and lunarpunk as the pragmatism required to get there.
