# Overview
* "Zuzalu.city is a decentralised open-source operating system that connects users to interoperable Ethereum ecosystem applications for innovating their communities."

# Technologies
* [Zupass](https://zupass.org/) has been used as a login/identity provider for multiple ZuVillages.
* [Zupoll](https://zupoll.org/) for polling.

Reproduced here verbatim for posterity and because they reflect a good deal of the network-societies ethos.
## Principles

Our mission for Zuzalu.city revolves around five key principles: privacy, ease-of-use, modularity, composability and interoperability. 

### Definitions of Principles

**Privacy** - We ensure user data is private and in the control of users. We use ZKPs and encryption to maintain privacy and provide the option for users to store data on Ceramic for full control.

**Ease-of-Use** - Packaging our complex tech stack in a simple user interface, we allow communities to customize their spaces and run their own modules without needing deep technical knowledge.

**Modularity** - Our operating system is built with independent modules each with their own attributes and functionality. This creates more flexibility for spaces to be adapted to the needs of any given community.

**Composability** - We design with the ability to integrate a combination of various modules or primitives, creating a customizable system for all users.

**Interoperability** - Integrations and native features share data via Ceramic and processes via smart contracts, allowing applications to interact and exchange data seamlessly.
## Alignment
* Open global participation: anyone in the world should be able to participate as a user, observer or developer, on a maximally equal footing. Participation should be permissionless.

* Decentralization: minimize the dependence of an application on any one single actor. In particular, an application should continue working even if its core developers disappear forever.

* Censorship resistance: centralized actors should not have the power to interfere with any given user's or application's ability to operate. Concerns around bad actors should be addressed at higher layers of the stack.

* Auditability: anyone should be able to validate an application's logic and its ongoing operation (eg. by running a full node) to make sure that it is operating according to the rules that its developers claim it is.
* Credible neutrality: base-layer infrastructure should be neutral, and in such a way that anyone can see that it is neutral even if they do not already trust the developers.

* Building tools, not empires. Empires try to capture and trap the user inside a walled garden; tools do their task but otherwise interoperate with a wider open ecosystem.

* Cooperative mindset: even while competing, projects within the ecosystem cooperate on shared software libraries, research, security, community building and other areas that are commonly valuable to them. Projects try to be positive-sum, both with each other and with the wider world.

## History 
Zuzalu.city was launched and tested as a permission-less shared calendar for all participants to self-organize programme in Montenegro in 2023 at Zuzalu, a 2-month experiment bringing together over 700 innovators including Ethereum researchers and developers, AI, longevity and biotech, European rationalists, and "tribes of the meta". In 2024, we entered the "Open Frontier" phase, focusing on creating a shared community-driven OS for technical project coordination and integration.



### 2024 Objectives & Tracks

We are building a decentralized operating system with open-source tools open for all communities to use for online and offline coordination, innovation, interoperability, and forking.

We are establishing a coordination system for builders of independent projects to collaborate and integrate modules into our operating system for widespread testing and adoption.

We are supporting emerging temporary and permanent crypto city movements and projects, recognizing the unique opportunity and need for these projects to communicate and coordinate using decentralized and privacy-first technology.
