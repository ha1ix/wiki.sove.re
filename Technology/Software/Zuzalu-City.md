# History via [Zupass.city](https://zuzalu.gitbook.io/zuzalu-beta-docs/welcome/zuzalu.city-vision-and-mission/2024-roadmap)
Zuzalu.city was launched and tested as a permission-less shared calendar for all participants to self-organize programme in Montenegro in 2023 at Zuzalu, a 2-month experiment bringing together over 700 innovators including Ethereum researchers and developers, AI, longevity and biotech, European rationalists, and "tribes of the meta". In 2024, we entered the "Open Frontier" phase, focusing on creating a shared community-driven OS for technical project coordination and integration.



## 2024 Objectives & Tracks

We are building a decentralized operating system with open-source tools open for all communities to use for online and offline coordination, innovation, interoperability, and forking.

We are establishing a coordination system for builders of independent projects to collaborate and integrate modules into our operating system for widespread testing and adoption.
