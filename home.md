Sove.re is neutral, open source community commons infrastructure to fill a communication/information gap in the network-societies ecosystem. Read more about it [here](/About). It hosts a [this wiki](wiki.sove.re), a [forum](forum.sove.re), encrypted [collborative docs](docs.sove.re), and a [calendar](https://docs.sove.re/calendar/#/2/calendar/view/RxxkYfLh-7yPbqzGv-c13a1ofRZkJF0QVWYTKXuqXf8/).
