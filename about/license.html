<h1>The word “soverent”</h1>
<p>The word "soverent" is a neologism and portmanteau combining the word "sovereign" (as in autonomous) and constituent (as in a part of a whole) to emphasize the agency/liberty/responsilbility of severeignity with the cooperative/community inherent in constituency. Other terms describing people interested in this movement, such as self-sovereign, fail to encompass the collaborative and social aspect that is integral to the philosophy.</p>
<p>We make no claim of ownership over the word, and it was invented as a sincere attempt to create a more useful way to describe the philosophy appearing in the network society and adjacent community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we ask that the word not be used commercially in any way, as this would only diminish the usefulness of the word. If it is useful to you to describe a philosophy or a holder of a philosophy use it in any context you wish, so long as you do not diminish or narrow the scope, meaning, or applicability of the word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because it is not owned, the word, if it is useful and used, will evolve over time, we make no claims about the future meaning or use of this word.</p>
<h1>The contents of Sove.re (Forum, Wiki, Docs, etc)</h1>
<p>The aim of of the Sove.re commons (the forum, wiki, docs and any future tools) is to be as open and accessible as possible. The information in it is likely to come from outside sources and no claim can be made to its proprietariness. We also hope that the content of this commons will benefit many people outside of Sove.re itself.</p>
<p>However, we do ask that the contents of the site (inclusive of the forum, wiki or docs and any future tools) are not reproduced in their entirety or in substantial parts outside of the platform. This is primarily out of the interest of the benefit of the commons itself, if it is “forked” then some of the benefits of a unified place to communicate are diminished. We also do not want the contributions of the community to ever be considered a “product” or be monetized in any way, which could be an intention or a side effect of copyting them. Of course any reasonable reproduction of small parts of the contents of Sove.re are fine and even beneficial, for example if you want to quote a wiki article, a forum comment or even an entire thread on your blog in order to contextualize it or delve more deeply into it, or for many other uses.&nbsp;</p>
