Sove.re is community commons infrastructure to fill a communication/information gap in the network-societies movement.

> "Soverent" is a neologism and portmanteau combining the word "sovereign" (as in autonomous) and constituent (as in a part of a whole) to emphasize the dual aspecs of agency and community inherent in network-societies. Other terms describing people interested in this movement, such as self-sovereign, fail to encompass the collaborative and social aspect that is integral to the philosophy. Feel free to use the word in other contexts if it is useful to you, [nobody owns it](/meta/License).

# List of tools
- Forum.sove.re
    - Instant messaging like Telegram can be ephemeral and disorganized, while many topics of discussion require long-term consideration and discussion. Instant messaging is important, but hopefully forum.sove.re can provide points of reference and "roll-ups" in a consolidated location.
- Wiki.sove.re
    - Similarly, forum discussions can further be "rolled up" into an even more organized and long-term-useful database. Eventually it could be useful to have an easy to navigate information resource covering the entire landscape of the network society ecosystem.
- Docs.sove.re
    - This is a CryptPad instance which provides a collaboration suite similar to Google Docs, except that it is entirely encrypted in browser so that not even the server can read any content. It is always painful to receive a google hosted document from a project furthering sovereignity. Hopefully by providing this service it will be easier for people to move away from centralized tools.



# Who is Sove.re for?

Built a public commons, the platform is for everyone interested in furthering human flourishing and soveregnity. This means individuals as well as open source projects that would benefit from the infrastructure provided by Sove.re. Projects/teams can eventually have their own subforums with independent moderation. To this end some of these subforums may even be private and for internal coordination of team members.

Sove.re is also for individuals who want to contribute to the network society present/future, or even just as a way to keep track of developments in the ecosystem. The entire point of Sove.re is Â to make it easier to stay up to date on the community at large, with all of its disparate projects, aims, and participants.


# Who is behind Sove.re?

Sove.re was initialized by [Riso Nonx](/people/riso) while attending [Edge City Lanna](/network-societies/pop-ups/edge-city#lanna). 

As soon as possible others will be invited to moderate and administrate the forum and wiki via DAO governance, and eventually the hosting infrastructure itself can be decentralized.
