# Overview
In response to an essay by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen titled ["The Techno-Optimist Manifesto"](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/) and as a corollary to [effective accelerationism](/Philosophy/eacc) (which in turn was partly a criticism of the conservatism of [Effective Altruism](/Philosophy/EA)), Vitalik Buterin published an essay titled [my techno optimism](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html) coining the term d/acc, or defensive accelerationism.

# Accelerationism
The "acc" in **d**efensive **acc**elerationism is a form of "techno optimism" in that it believes that technology can improve human civilization and we should pursue this outcome as quickly as is safely possible (as opposed to decelerationists, such as AI "doomers", who think technology is more likely to damage humanity than improve it in the long run, or luddites, who would prefer we undo some of our technologies and return to relatively more primitive states).

# Denfensive
The "d" stands for defensive, which differeniates between this philosophy and and the most optimistic of techno-optimists. d/acc promotes careful consideration of the technologies we build becaues it  believes that certain branches of technological development could be dangerous.
