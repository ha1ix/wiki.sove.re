# Overview
Grange.la is a federated microblog server (like xitter, but more like mastodon/pleroma) running [Mitra](https://codeberg.org/silverpill/mitra) software, written in Rust, with Ethereum wallet (optional Sign-In-With-Ethereum) and public key integration. It is [lunarpunk](/philosophy/lunarpunk) -- [d/acc](/philosophy/dacc) themed and maintained as a Soverents Community Commons.

The name LaGrange Punkts is a reference to Lagrange points, places between two rotating bodies (such as the moon and the earth) where centrifugal forces and gravity cancel out and minimal/no energy is required to stay parked. It is the hypothesized ideal point for space colonies, and there are already man made objects taking advantage of this phenomenon.
