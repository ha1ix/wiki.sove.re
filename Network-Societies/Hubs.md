# Overview
Hubs are physical placesthat will not move, as opposed to a Pop-Up City which may occur in a different location on each iteration. Hubs could be open year round or operate seasonally. Hubs may have long term residents, although as opposed to many existing intentional communities, Hubs maintain their accessibility to digital nomads and temporary visitors.
