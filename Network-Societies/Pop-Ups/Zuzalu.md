2023: First Zuzalu

The first idea of Zuzalu started on a post Crypto Cities. Over time the idea manifested to an experiment with the first iteration being: Zuzalu Montenegro. The goal: Create a pop-up city that houses 200+ people from a diverse variety of regions and fields together for 2 months aimed to blend a variety of cultures fostering an environment where innovative experiments could make positive impacts on the world.

2024: Open Frontier

At the end of 2023, the Zuzalu frontier was opened:

    We take the 2024 “spring of spinoffs” concept as inspiration, and make that be the only thing we do in 2024. We extend it to cover the whole year.

    We intentionally do NOT DO any of the following:

        Have an explicit primary headline long-duration event

        Have an explicit concept of “Zuzalu citizens” or “Zuzalu residents”

        Attach the name “Zuzalu” to a specific physical event in general

    We DO:

        Actively encourage people, both inside the existing community and on the edges of it, to run their own Zu-villages. It’s totally okay and even encouraged for some of these Zu-villages to be simultaneous with and beside each other!

        Strongly consider providing funding to some of these groups

        Continue to stay together as a group, both virtually and through in-person chats at various Zu-villages, to (i) coordinate on supporting digital public goods that would be common across these Zu-villages and (ii) engage in cross-pollination and intellectual discussion

        Continue to be open to multiple paths in 2025, eg: moving toward becoming “United Networks”, coming back into doing some kind of larger event, etc. 2024 will be Zuzalu 2.0, 2025 will be Zuzalu 3.0; the future going that far out is unknown.

In 2024, Zuzalu has grown into a decentralised movement with many initiatives. 

⚠️ There is no official Zuzalu account, so watch out for anything that claims to be a single source of truth for "Zuzalu" as a whole.
