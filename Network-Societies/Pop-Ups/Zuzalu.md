# Overview
Following a 2021 blog post called [Crypto-Cities](/Network-Societies/Crypto-Cities-VB) and another about [Network States](/Network-Societies/Network-States-VB) by Vitalik Buterin, Zuzalu was an experimental pop-up community established in 2023 in Montenegro, combining elements of tech conferences, hacker houses, and intentional communities. The project hosted 200 residents from diverse regions and fields for a two-month period "to blend a variety of cultures fostering an environment where innovative experiments could make positive impacts on the world." It has inspired a series of other [Pop-Ups](/Network-Societies/Pop-Ups), sometimes referred to as [ZuVillages.](/Network-Societies/Pop-ups/ZuVillage)

Vitalik wrote about his Zuzalu experience in an article, [Why I Built Zuzalu](/Network-Societies/Pop-Ups/Zuzalu/Why-VB).

## 2024: Open Frontier

At the end of 2023, the Zuzalu frontier was opened:

* We take the 2024 “spring of spinoffs” concept as inspiration, and make that be the only thing we do in 2024. We extend it to cover the whole year.
* We intentionally do NOT DO any of the following:
    * Have an explicit primary headline long-duration event
    * Have an explicit concept of “Zuzalu citizens” or “Zuzalu residents”
    * Attach the name “Zuzalu” to a specific physical event in general
    
 * We do:
     * Actively encourage people, both inside the existing community and on the edges of it, to run their own Zu-villages. It’s totally okay and even encouraged for some of these Zu-villages to be simultaneous with and beside each other!
     * Strongly consider providing funding to some of these groups
     * Continue to stay together as a group, both virtually and through in-person chats at various Zu-villages, to (i) coordinate on supporting digital public goods that would be common across these Zu-villages and (ii) engage in cross-pollination and intellectual discussion
     * Continue to be open to multiple paths in 2025, eg: moving toward becoming “United Networks”, coming back into doing some kind of larger event, etc. 2024 will be Zuzalu 2.0, 2025 will be Zuzalu 3.0; the future going that far out is unknown.
     
In 2024, Zuzalu has grown into a decentralised movement with many initiatives. 

⚠️ There is no official Zuzalu account, so watch out for anything that claims to be a single source of truth for "Zuzalu" as a whole.
