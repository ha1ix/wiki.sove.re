# Overview

Edge City is a continuing series of "pop-up villages" founded by [Janine Leger](/People/Janine-Leger) and [Timour Kosters](/People/Timour-Kosters) in 2024. Their locations vary and the number of full time attendees is around the [dunbar number](/Glossary) of 200-300, while in total over a thousand may visit. The description on their site as of 2024 is: "Edge City convenes people working at the frontiers of tech, science, and society in popup villages across the globe. We aspire to be a ‘society and culture incubator’— an IRL lab of experimentation for new ideas, tech, culture, and organizations, all dedicated to accelerating human flourishing." 
They have three "impact areas:"
* Encourage, educate and inspire attendees "to do the most impactful work of their lives."
* Incubate projects
* Advance governance and community models

Edge City is part of the [ZuVillage](/Network-Societies/ZuVillage) lineage of pop-ups, with co-founder Janine Leger also organizing the original [Zuzalu](/Network-Societies/Pop-Ups/Zuzalu)
