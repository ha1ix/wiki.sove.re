# Method One
[Join the Soverents guild](https://guild.xyz/soverents) and request the Wiki Editor role. After you have achieved this, add a link to your guild account profile to your forum.sove.re profile and indicate your interest on [this thread](https://forum.sove.re/forum/topic/4/request-editor-role). Note: this requires some reputation on the forum so as to screen bad-faith editors.

# Method Two
This method does not require manual changes to your account and instead follows standard git practices. It requires a github account, some familiarity with git, and ability to format your additions to match the repo/page formatting. While this will allow you to submit pull requests, it is still useful to join the guild account above and connect your github.

Every pag has an "Edit on Github" button.
