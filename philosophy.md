# Overview
Network-society is fundamentally about improving and [defending human agency](/philosophy/dacc). The path toward a world that is the most accommodating to this and other human values requires experimentation and iteration. Network-societies are incubators for testing new ways to foster sovereignity, coordination, transparency, and governance. By furthering these foundations of liberty and freedom future societies will be able to better pursue human flourishing in its many personal forms.
