# Overview
Network-society is fundamentally about improving and [defending human agency](/Philosophy/DACC). The path toward a world that is the most accommodating to this and other human values requires experimentation and iteration. Network-societies are incubators for testing new ways to foster sovereignity, coordination, transparency, and governance. By furthering these foundations of liberty and freedom future societies will be able to better pursue human flourishing in its many personal forms.


## Plurality

## [d/acc](/Philosophy/DACC)
As a response to effective accelerationism [e/acc](/Philosophy/eacc), which in turn was partly a criticism of [Effective Altruism](/Philosophy/EA), [Vitalik Buterin](/People/Vitalik) coined the term d/acc, or defensive accelerationism.


# Big Note
There is no consistent philosophy beyond "lets try to live in a new way" for the many projects, each has its own philosophy and focus.
