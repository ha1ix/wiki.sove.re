# Overview
Network-society is fundamentally about improving and [defending human agency](/Philosophy/DACC). The path toward a world that is the most accommodating to this and other human values requires experimentation and iteration. Network-societies are incubators for testing new ways to foster sovereignity, coordination, transparency, and governance. By furthering these foundations of liberty and freedom future societies will be able to better pursue human flourishing in its many personal forms.

The movement can be organized into two types: "Startup" and "Village."

# Startup Cities
These are cities founded from a tech-startup, venture capital frame of reference. While they aim to increase human agency, it is in the context of allowing novel economic experiments and pathways for profit. Often they are set in "special economic zones" allowing more experimental frameworks for pursuing things like medicine that may not fit in the legal framework of existing cities/states.

Balajian Network States are inside of this philosophical framework.

# ["ZuVillages"](/Network-Societies/Pop-Ups/Zuvillage)
While both flavors of network-societies are incubators for innovation, a key differentiation is that ZuVillage style network-societies promote open source technology and seek avenues of "human flourishing" instead of profit.

## [d/acc](/Philosophy/DACC)
As a response to effective accelerationism [e/acc](/Philosophy/eacc), which in turn was partly a criticism of [Effective Altruism](/Philosophy/EA), [Vitalik Buterin](/People/Vitalik) coined the term d/acc, or defensive accelerationism.
