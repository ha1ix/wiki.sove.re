### Technology for Human Flourishing
While the values of network-societies are not homogenous, rigid or even particularly well defined on small scales, at this stage some common themes many participants share are human agency and transparency. The path toward a world that is the most accommodating to these and other human values often requires new technology. These technologies foster improved coordination, collaboration, governance, etc. We break these technologies into thre categories:


## [Software](/Technology/Software)
These are digital.

## [Hardware](/Technology/Hardware)
These are physical. For example, established permanent spaces. See [Hubs](/Technology/Hardware/Hubs).

## [Social](/Technology/Social)
**This does not mean "social media."** Things like handshakes and bowing are social technologies that offer a novel way of interacting with others, improving understanding, cohesion and lowering social friction.
