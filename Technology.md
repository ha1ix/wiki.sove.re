*[Discussion](https://forum.sove.re/category/6/technology)*

Network-society is fundamentally about improving and [defending human agency](/Philosophy/DACC). The path toward a world that is the most accommodating to this and other human values requires new technology. These technologies foster sovereignity, coordination, transparency, and governance. These are the foundations of liberty and freedom to pursue human flourishing in its many personal forms. We break these technologies into thre categories:

## [Software](/Technology/Software)
These are digital.

## [Hardware](/Technology/Hardware)
These are physical. For example, established permanent spaces. See [Hubs](/Technology/Hardware/Hubs).

## [Social](/Technology/Social)
**This does not mean "social media."** Things like handshakes and bowing are social technologies that offer a novel way of interacting with others, improving understanding, cohesion and lowering social friction.
