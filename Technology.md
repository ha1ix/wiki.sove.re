### Technology for Human Flourishing
The network society movement cares deeply about human agency, liberty and sovereignity. The path toward a world that is the most accommodating to these and other human values often requires new technology. These technologies foster improved coordination, transparency, governance, connection, agency, sovereignity, etc. We break these technologies into thre categories:

## [Social](/Technology/Social)
* **This does not mean "social media."** Things like handshakes and bowing are social technologies that offer a novel way of interacting with others.

## [Software](/Technology/Software)
* These are digital creations that foster improved coordination, governance, connection, sovereignity, etc.

## [Hardware](/Technology/Hardware)
These are physical. For example, established permanent spaces. See [Hubs](/Technology/Hardware/Hubs).
