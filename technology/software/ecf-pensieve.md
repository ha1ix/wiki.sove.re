# Overview

ECF Pensieve is the [Ethereum Community Fund](https://ecf.network)'s platform for community-driven project discovery, tracking, and grant allocation. It functions as a public ledger of project contribution histories, with Transparency and Accountability scores determining grant eligibility — no gatekeepers, permissionless participation.

> "Public goods deserve sunlight. Too often, early projects — the ones without tokens, hype, or venture backing — are left unfunded and unseen." — ECF

# Perennial Grant Experiment

A 10-week rolling grant program distributing weekly payments to projects based on their Pensieve scores. All payouts are streamed on-chain via [Sablier](https://sablier.com), making disbursements fully public and auditable. Anyone can contribute to, propose, review, or challenge projects without permission.

The **ZuVillage Special Grant** was a two-week sub-round within the Perennial Grant Experiment, directed specifically at pop-up village projects. Winners of the first round (announced at the [Zuzalu Software Townhall, Devcon 7](/network-societies/pop-ups/devcon)):
- **ETHChiangmai** — Ethereum community gathering in Chiang Mai around Devcon 7
- **ZuKas** — Pop-up in Kaş, Turkey; announced ZuKas II and the ZuGov protocol alpha

# Features

- **Pensieve Ads** — ad slots priced via Harberger tax: holders self-assess value and pay a continuous tax on that assessment; anyone can buy the slot at the self-assessed price at any time. Mechanism aligns pricing with genuine willingness to pay.
- **MySieve** — curation and sorting layer for grant and project discovery within the platform.
