# Overview
Privacy does not mean you have something to hide, it means you have the freedom to disclose your personal information at will. Imagine if ones personal thoughts were not private, how little risk, innovation, or creativity there would be. Computers are "bicycles for the mind," extensions of our own intellectual capabilities, and so demand a similar amount of privacy.
