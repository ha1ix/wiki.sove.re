# Overview

Gitcoin is the primary implementation of [Quadratic Funding](/technology/software/quadratic-funding) in the Ethereum ecosystem. It runs grant rounds that distribute matching funds to open source software, community infrastructure, and public goods projects — allocating matching based on breadth of community support rather than donation size.

Many projects in the ZuVillage and network-state ecosystem have been funded through Gitcoin Grants rounds, making it a significant piece of the financial infrastructure underlying this community.
