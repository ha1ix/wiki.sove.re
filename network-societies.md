There is emerging a logical taxonomy of network-societies organized by scale; pop-up villages on one end are ~150 people while nations are obviously much larger.
# Small
## [Pop Ups Villages](/network-societies/pop-ps)
Temporary villages/towns/cities for incubating novel social technologies.

## [Hubs](/Network-Societies/Hubs)/Network Cities
More permanent settlements.

# Medium
## Startup Cities
These are a type of Hub, cities founded from a tech-startup, venture capital frame of reference. While they aim to increase human agency in some ways, it is in the context of allowing novel economic experiments and pathways for profit. Often they are set in "special economic zones" allowing more experimental frameworks for pursuing things like medicine that may not fit in the legal framework of existing cities/states.


# Large
## Confederacies/Network States/Nations
Balajian Network States are inside of this philosophical framework.
