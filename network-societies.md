# [Pop Ups Villages](/Network-Societies/Pop-Ups)
Temporary villages/towns/cities for incubating novel social technologies.
# [Hubs](/Network-Societies/Hubs)
More permanent experimental communities.

# Startup Cities
These are cities founded from a tech-startup, venture capital frame of reference. While they aim to increase human agency in some ways, it is in the context of allowing novel economic experiments and pathways for profit. Often they are set in "special economic zones" allowing more experimental frameworks for pursuing things like medicine that may not fit in the legal framework of existing cities/states.

Balajian Network States are inside of this philosophical framework.
