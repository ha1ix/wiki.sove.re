# Overview

A **Network Society** is a decentralized, digitally-native community bound by shared values, protocols, and governance systems rather than geographic borders.

## Core Components
- Digital-first coordination
- Opt-in membership
- Shared economic systems
- Collective governance
- Portable identity/reputation
- Mixed physical/digital presence

## Implementation Layers
1. **Social Layer**
   - Community values
   - Cultural norms
   - Shared narratives

2. **Protocol Layer**
   - Smart contracts
   - Governance mechanisms
   - Economic systems
   - Identity systems

3. **Physical Layer**
   - Pop-up gatherings
   - Co-living spaces
   - Temporary autonomous zones
   - Remote work hubs

## PrototypicalExamples
- Open source communities
- DAO ecosystems
- Digital nomad networks
- Hackerspaces/makerspaces
- Decentralized social platforms

## Economic Models
- Shared treasury
- Token-based incentives
- Contribution tracking
- Reputation systems
- P2P exchange

*Think: Discord + Ethereum + Airbnb, but for entire communities*


There is emerging a logical taxonomy of network-societies organized by scale; pop-up villages on one end are ~150 people while nations are obviously much larger.

# Taxonomy

## Small
### [Pop Ups Villages](/network-societies/pop-ups)
Temporary villages/towns/cities for incubating novel social technologies.

### [Hubs](/network-societies/hubs)
More permanent settlements.

## Medium
### Pop Up Cities
   - Multiple villages gathering as neighbors
   - Cross-coordination between communities
   - Shared resources and learning
### Startup Cities
These are cities founded from a tech-startup, venture capital frame of reference. While they aim to increase human agency in some ways, it is in the context of allowing novel economic experiments and pathways for profit. Often they are set in "special economic zones" allowing more experimental frameworks for pursuing things like medicine that may not fit in the legal framework of existing cities/states.

### [Intentional Communities](/network-societies/ic)
These are their own category outside of the specific scope of this wiki, but share many of the communal, decentralized values of other network-societies.


## Large
### Archipelagos/Confederacies/Network States/Nations
   - Networks of aligned communities
   - Shared manifestos/social contracts
   - Decentralized governance
   - May evolve from temporary to permanent communities
   - Multi-generational communities
   - May innovate as charter cities
   - May seek
   
### Examples
* [Chiang Mai Archipelago 2024 ](/network-societies/archipelago2024)
* [Balajian Network States](https://docs.sove.re/sheet/#/3/sheet/edit/ce2a6be7892e3bf3900f5c1677c7e2fe/) are an example.

# Discussion
These classifications are mostly hypothetical and evolving. Please contribute your insights and discuss at [this forum topic](https://forum.sove.re/topic/34/taxonomy-of-network-societies)
