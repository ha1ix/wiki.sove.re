There is emerging a logical taxonomy of network-societies organized by scale; pop-up villages on one end are ~150 people while nations are obviously much larger.


# Small
## [Pop Ups Villages](/network-societies/pop-ps)
Temporary villages/towns/cities for incubating novel social technologies.

## [Hubs](/Network-Societies/Hubs)/Network Cities
More permanent settlements.

# Medium
## Pop Up Cities
   - Multiple villages gathering as neighbors
   - Cross-coordination between communities
   - Shared resources and learning
## Startup Cities
These are cities founded from a tech-startup, venture capital frame of reference. While they aim to increase human agency in some ways, it is in the context of allowing novel economic experiments and pathways for profit. Often they are set in "special economic zones" allowing more experimental frameworks for pursuing things like medicine that may not fit in the legal framework of existing cities/states.


# Large
## Confederacies/Network States/Nations
   - Networks of aligned communities
   - Shared manifestos/social contracts
   - Decentralized governance
   - May evolve from temporary to permanent communities
   - Multi-generational communities
   - May innovate as charter cities
   
[Balajian Network States](https://docs.sove.re/sheet/#/3/sheet/edit/ce2a6be7892e3bf3900f5c1677c7e2fe/) are an example.

# Discussion
These classifications are mostly hypothetical and evolving. Please contribute your insights and discuss at [this forum topic](https://forum.sove.re/topic/34/taxonomy-of-network-societies)
