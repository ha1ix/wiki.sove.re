<p>Happy New Year's Eve, everyone! It's been a whirlwind of a year in the Zu-niverse, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this edition of the newsletter, you'll find some highlights ‚Äì a portion of the energy and momentum our movement saw in 2024 ‚Äì as well as upcoming events because no, we're not slowing down. ‚úä</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also think it's time to revamp the Zuzalu newsletter in the coming year. I've enjoyed keeping this mailing list alive with your submissions, and appreciate the surprising number of silent readers:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subscribers and submissions have been gated to those that attended Zuzalu and ZuConnect, and I think it's time for both to change to reflect how our movement continues to grow and diversify. Next year, I'd like to make the newsletter more open: for people to subscribe and submit content to share. I've also chatted with some folks about incorporating more diverse forms of media. If you're interested in joining forces to revamp the Zuzalu Community Newsletter in 2025, please reach out! ü§ó</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without further ado, your 2024 Retrospective:</p>

<p>"I've been a nomad for 7 years and had a couple good friends that I meet in different countries. I'm blown away by how fast the Zuzalu community has become integrated, and integral, to my life and soul."</p>

<p>"A ZK community just ran their own $500 prize on viaPrize without any assistance from our team! We are thrilled to see the platform reach a point of autonomous use. In our journey making viaPrize easier to use, we learned to let customers pay with credit card and forward those payments to the business as crypto. We now offer this as a service at normie.tech! On to the next adventure :)"</p>

<p>"Castalia, a DeSci-focused pop-up city, took over Mexico this Nov/Dec. The event focused on onboarding normie scientists, connecting with local web3 communities, and hacking on DeSci projects. Highlights included Plague Hunt (Pok√©mon Go but for diseased treesü§î), a Christmas Posada and of course the tacos! There will be a bigger event in Mexico in Q3‚Äîjoin the TG to stay updated: https://t.me/CastaliaCity"</p>

<p>"In 2024, Zuitzerland has blossomed from an idea into a bold experiment for a permanent network state and society sandbox, inspired by Switzerland's 700-year history of decentralization. In September, we gathered 35+ governance pioneers for 10 days in Interlaken to co-design Zuitzerland‚Äôs next steps, shaping a vision for a frontier governance sandbox in Switzerland. Just before Christmas, we secured (ü§û) our permanent village location, setting the stage for our first full-scale event in 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zuitzerland 2025 will be focused on seeding long-term communities and bringing Zuitzerland‚Äôs longer-term vision to life with our residents. Curious about what‚Äôs next? Join our X Space this Friday at 6 PM UTC, where we‚Äôll share what Zuitzerland 2025 holds and how you can be part of this journey!"</p>

<p>"ZuTech day was a special moment spanning the many pop up experiments in Chiang Mai this fall. Builders across the archipelago came together to discuss open source and decentralization software values, and opinions and ideas proliferated on both the abstract and technical levels. As many of us collaborate on projects remotely, this no-gadget IRL day was a unique opportunity to connect face to face with friends and colleagues we've gotten to know over the past years in the Zuzalu technology ecosystem."</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Binius, finally completed my blog post on it! https://0xmilica.com/post/binius/</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I recently learned that baths in Japan have a "reheat" function so you can stay nice and cozy while u soak for hours without needing to add hot water and overflow. Revolutionary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your hopes for Zuzalu in 2025?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to see all of us in Montenegro again, where it all started :)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;More 6+ week events. More property purchases. More love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sending love to my Zuzalu people &lt;3</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We are in the process of closing on 2 more houses in the network bringing the total to 4 by end of 2024. If you're interested in buying a house and joining our village then contact the Pirate King.</p>
