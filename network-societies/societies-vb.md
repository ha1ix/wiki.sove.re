# Overview

*Let a Thousand Societies Bloom* (December 2025) is Vitalik Buterin's most detailed essay on the network societies space since his 2022 review of Balaji's *The Network State*. Written after two years of real-world experimentation — Zuzalu, ZuConnect, the Chiang Mai Archipelago, and many independent spinoffs — it moves from theory to a concrete framework for what these communities could become.

The essay names four interconnected entity types: **Tribes**, **Hubs**, **Zones**, and **The Archipelago**. Together these are meant to form a new layer of intermediate institutions between individuals and nation-states.

# Intellectual Lineage

Vitalik lists the prior traditions feeding into this movement:

- Balaji Srinivasan's [*The Network State*](/network-societies/network-states-vb) (2022)
- The [coordi-nations](https://jessykate.medium.com/coordi-nations-a-new-institutional-structure-for-global-cooperation-3ef38d6e2cfa) / networked nations movement
- [Phyles](/philosophy/phyles) — David de Ugarte's transnational cultural-economic networks
- Seasteading, Liberland, Sealand
- Charter Cities Institute
- Estonian e-residency
- Bhutan's [Gelephu Mindfulness City](https://gmc.bt/)
- Freetown Christiania, Walt Disney's EPCOT

# What We Learned From Zuzalu

The essay draws practical lessons from the original 2023 experiment:

- **~200 people (Dunbar's number) is the right size.** Large enough to sustain subcultures; small enough for everyone to know each other.
- **1–2 months is the right duration.** "A week is a break from your life; two months is your life." Longer stays change people's orientation from tourist to resident.
- **"A college at 25% intensity."** Enough programming to stimulate people, not enough to exhaust them. Explicit no-event windows recommended.
- **The Chiang Mai model.** "5–10 popups, each independently bringing 30–300 people, co-located in the same city around the same time" — coordination without centralized control.

**Limits of popups:**
- Short-term rental is expensive; you negotiate in an unfamiliar market.
- Hard to create depth of cultural environment in 40 days.
- Involving locals non-superficially requires returning for years.
- Without legal staying power, governance experiments are limited to "forking" (someone unhappy can just start a new popup).
- Risk of regression: over time, popups trend shorter, smaller, and more generic, approaching ordinary conferences.

# Framework

## Tribes

The central new concept. A tribe is a 21st-century intermediate institution organized around **culture** — not geography, ethnicity, or religion. Tribes address the "atomistic yet authoritarian" critique of modern society: we have individuals and states, with too little in between.

Tribes differ from corporations (profit motive homogenizes) and social media (scales by appealing to everyone, reducing distinctiveness to zero). A tribe is explicitly *not* trying to become a megacorporation.

Key function: **cultural innovation**. Tribes experiment with norms, rituals, aesthetics, diets, governance — and successful experiments spread through the Archipelago.

## Hubs

Permanent physical nodes — as opposed to popups, which move or dissolve. Examples mentioned:

- **Frontier Tower** — permanent node
- **[Crecimiento](/network-societies/hubs/list)** / Aleph (Argentina)
- **4seas** — two nodes in Chiang Mai (one city, one mountain)
- **[Balaji's Network School](https://networkschool.com/)**
- **[Vitalia](/network-societies/hubs/list)** (Honduras) — already split into two forks

Hubs provide what popups cannot: long-term residency, stable infrastructure, the ability to build culture that deepens over years. The standing risk is "regression to the mean" — becoming a glorified coworking space.

[Edge City](/network-societies/pop-ups/edge-city) is noted as having "perfected a pipeline" for running popups and being cash-flow-positive — a model for sustainability.

## Zones

Legal governance experiments: regions where a host country grants special regulatory conditions to attract innovation. Vitalik's proposed policy palette includes:

- **Open immigration via vouching**: instead of state-regulated immigration, vouchers from established community members serve as the gating mechanism — more trust-based, less bureaucratic
- **Democracy experiments**: novel voting mechanisms, liquid democracy, participatory budgeting
- **Urban governance innovation**: flexible zoning, community land trusts, new ownership models

The question of why countries would host zones: economic development, prestige, tax revenue, technology transfer.

## The Archipelago

The connected network of Tribes + Hubs + Zones, loosely coordinated across geography. Each node maintains its distinctiveness; the network provides mutual support, shared tools, and cross-pollination.

This is the long-term vision: not a single new city or country, but a distributed layer of culturally specific, experimentally rich communities that remain legible to each other.

# Relation to Existing Concepts

| Concept | Relationship |
|---|---|
| [ZuVillage](/network-societies/pop-ups/zuvillage) | Canonical popup format; the starting point for Tribes |
| [Hubs](/network-societies/hubs) | Direct instantiation of Vitalik's "Hubs" concept |
| [Archipelago 2024](/network-societies/archipelago2024) | Chiang Mai co-location model, now a named template |
| [Phyles](/philosophy/phyles) | Historical precursor to Tribes |
| [Network State](/network-societies/network-states-vb) | Related tradition; Vitalik's approach is more pluralistic and less sovereignty-focused |
