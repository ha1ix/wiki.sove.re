# Overview
The Future Living DAO is architecting a framework for the design and development of hubs (aka 'Lighthouses') and their interoperation. 

> Our vision is to create a decentralized network of "intelligent Lighthouses" – that serve as living laboratories for advancing civilization and human flourishing. The Ultramodern movement aims to revolutionize buildings and villages.

> Lighthouses will integrate cutting-edge technology, sustainable practices, and be owned by the community to create environments that foster human flourishing and technological advancement.

# Ultramodern
The Future Living DAO has coined the phrase 'Ultramodern' to reflect a new kind of community with specific values and construction.

## Mission Oriented Communities
* Open-source ethos (OG opensource vibes)
* Decentralized organization principles - radically strong coordination work
* Cutting-edge innovation (Xerox parc)
* Visionary governance (Network states)

## Community Values
* Intrinsically Motivated Innovators: Like the pioneers of open-source software, our members are self-driven to invent out of pure desire to evolve technology and society.
* Decentralized Coordination Experts Leveraging the power of DAOs, we excel at remote collaboration, development, and shared incentives within our global community.
* Tech-Optimists Inspired by Xerox PARC and Bell Labs, we're a group of technologists committed to building the future 30 years ahead of its time, coordinated through blockchain technology.
* Network State Pioneers Evolving from co-living tribes to a global, decentralized community united under a shared vision of advancing civilization.

## Technical Standards
* Token-based incentive systems
* Interoperability and open standards
