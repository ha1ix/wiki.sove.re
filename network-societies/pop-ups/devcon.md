# Overview

Devcon is the annual Ethereum developer conference organized by the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation). It is the primary recurring gathering of the Ethereum ecosystem — researchers, protocol developers, application builders, and adjacent communities including much of the pop-up village world.

# Devcon 7 SEA — Bangkok, 2024

Devcon 7, held in Bangkok, Thailand in November 2024, was notable for coinciding with an unusually dense cluster of pop-up villages in the region. The [Chiang Mai Archipelago](/network-societies/archipelago2024) — over a dozen simultaneous pop-up communities in Chiang Mai — was timed deliberately between Token 2049 in Singapore and Devcon in Bangkok, creating an extended season of in-person coordination across Thailand. [Edge City Lanna](/network-societies/pop-ups/edge-city#lanna) ran October–November in Chiang Mai and fed directly into Devcon week.

The result was one of the largest concentrations of ZuVillage-lineage participants in one region at one time. A [Popup City talk at Devcon 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fs8S9UaGQhM7TrEzEwYwZ6MoTG_HFF33ImoHgGb3Il0/edit#slide=id.g317a93de408_0_14) documented the history and lineage of pop-up communities.

# Significance to this ecosystem

Devcon functions as a gravity well for the ZuVillage ecosystem. Pop-up events frequently cluster around it geographically and temporally — participants extend their travel to absorb both the conference and surrounding villages. Many of the projects documented in this wiki were demoed, announced, or coordinated at Devcon.
