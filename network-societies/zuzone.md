# Overview

ZuZone is the connective layer for the Zuzalu ecosystem — "a shared home where permanent hubs and pop-up cities come together, learn from each other, and grow as one global community." The project was born out of the decentralized ZuVillage movement and aims to keep it aligned, supported, and transparent without centralizing it.

> "Born from the spirit of Zuzalu, ZuZone exists to make sure that what we are building across the world stays aligned, supported, transparent, and human."

The primary technical output so far is the **zuletter**: a community newsletter built as a GitHub-native, fully auditable system with no proprietary servers or databases — data lives in GitHub Issues and Markdown files, the UI is a Next.js app on Vercel.
