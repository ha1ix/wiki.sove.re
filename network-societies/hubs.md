# Overview
Hubs are physical places that will not move, as opposed to a Pop-Up City which may occur in a different location on each iteration. Hubs could be open year round or operate seasonally. Hubs may have long term residents, although as opposed to many existing intentional communities, Hubs  maintain their accessibility to digital nomads and temporary visitors.

# Hub: A Modern Third Place

## Vision
A new category of community space designed to bridge the gap between libraries, coworking spaces, malls, and social clubs. Hubs serve as "third places" - spaces between home and work where people can gather, work, and connect.

## Core Elements

- Community gathering and connection
- Flexible workspace for remote workers
- Cultural and creative activities
- Healthy commerce and food options
- Multi-generational engagement

### Design Principles

- Natural light and open spaces
- Safe and vibrant atmosphere
- Community-involved design process
- Sustainable and wellness-focused

### Key Features
- Work and builder spaces
- Event venues
- Healthy food stalls and cafes
- Community programming
- Mixed-use capabilities including potential housing

## Organizational Model

### Structure
- Public-Private Partnership (PPP) or Public-Private-Community Partnership (PPCP)
- Community involvement through:
  - Co-design processes
  - Voting mechanisms
  - Contribution recognition
  - Membership programs

### Night Utilization
- Potential for affordable housing units
- Artist & startup residencies
- Operational staff housing
- Community contribution programs

## Addressing Modern Challenges
- Remote work isolation
- Downtown revitalization
- Public space scarcity
- Community disconnection
- Commercial real estate adaptation
- Vacated mall spaces
- Lack of foot traffic
- Drop in downtown real estate value



## Vision of Success
The ultimate goal is for "Hub" to become a recognized venue category alongside cafes, restaurants, and libraries, representing a new standard in community spaces that combines commerce, culture, and community.
