# About
Riso has been contributing to open source software for close to two decades, and blockchain for over a decade. He drafted a protocol for decentralized ETH staking which later went on to become [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net), a piece of Ethereum infrastructure. He has been interested in intentional communities for many years and attended his first ZuVillage in 2024 at Edge Lanna.

He also has a complete physical collection of Whole Earth Catalogs, including the CoEvolution Quarterly and Whole Earth Review magazines.
