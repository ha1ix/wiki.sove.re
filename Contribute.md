# Method One
The first method requires an administrator manually granting editing privileges to your account. First, register an account on the wiki. Then reach out via the [Forum](https://forum.sove.re/forum/topic/4/request-editor-role) to have your wiki account privileges raised. Note: this requires some reputation on the forum so as to screen bad-faith editors.

# Method Two
This method does not require manual changes to your account and instead follows standard git practices. It requires a github account, some familiarity with git, and ability to format your additions to match the repo/page formatting. If you prefer to edit the wiki using the wiki GUI you will have to follow the procedure in Method One above.
